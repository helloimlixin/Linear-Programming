# Introduction: Linear Programming Formulations and Examples

Different formulations of linear programs show the great applicability of Linear Programming to a good variety of contexts. Here, we will discuss about some popular formulations, which specifically, *General* and *Standard* formulations and the conversion between these formulations. We'll finish up by talking about some real-world examples of linear programs to show the practicability of Linear Programming on complex problems.

## Linear Programming Formulations

There are generally two formulations of a linear program: *General Form* and *Standard Form*, we will discuss these formulations with the following example:

$$\small \begin{matrix}
&minimize &2x_1 &- &x_2 &+ &4x_3\\
&subject \text{ } to &x_1 &+ &x_2 & & &+ &x_4 &\leq &2\\
& & & &3x_2 &- &x_3 & & &= &5\\
& & & & & &x_3 &+ &x_4 &\geq &2\\
& &x_1 & & & & & & &\geq &0\\
& & & & & &x_3 & & &\leq &0.
\end{matrix}$$
